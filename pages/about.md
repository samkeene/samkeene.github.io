I am a professor of [electrical engineering](http://www.ee.cooper.edu) at [The Cooper Union](http://www.cooper.edu)

I teach courses and advise students in the area of signal processing, wireless communications and networks, machine learning and data science.

This website is meant to highlight all the great things Cooper students are doing under my supervision in these areas.

# Masters Theses
One of the most rewarding aspects of being a professor is advising Masters Theses. 
There is nothing better than working closely with smart people towards a shared goal.
