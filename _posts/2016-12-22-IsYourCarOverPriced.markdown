An example of some of the work my students did this semester.
They scraped some data about car features and prices and built some models to predict the prices. They investigated what car features contribute most to the prices, and then, perhaps most interestingly, determined which cars are most overpriced based on predicted price vs actual price. Sound interesting? The data and code is open sourced now and up on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jshih7/d/CooperUnion/cardataset/car-price-prediction)
