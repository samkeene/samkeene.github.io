We wrapped up our Data Science and Design Projects for Social Good recently. COVID-19 naturally made for a significant disruption of the semester, but nonetheless there are some really exciting projects that came out of the course. While we weren't able to have our usual exhibition, we were able to put up websites highligthing some of the work.
