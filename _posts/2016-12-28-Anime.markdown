Are you bored on your break and want to find some new anime to watch? Why not try out Xiangling Kong and Venkat Kuruturi's [final project for statistical learning](http://anime.kongio.com:5000/)
The data scraped for this rec system is uploaded to Kaggle in case you want to [build your own:](https://www.kaggle.com/xthun…/anime-recommendations-database)
