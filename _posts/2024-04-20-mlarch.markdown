Along with my colleague Ben Aranda, we hosted the 2nd Workshop on Generative Art, Architecture & Engineering Collaboration. Leading practitioners in the field of generative art, design and machine learning presented their work and engaged in a discussion led by students. This workshop was an extension ofour multi-year effort to explore generative algorithms and Machine Learning at Cooper Union through a series of interdisciplinary seminars and studios, where students from the art, architecture and engineering schools work together. 

Our panelists included:
    

As part of this workshop, we also exhibited the work from our Generative Machine Learning for Architecture and Art course. Some of the work is shown below.
