Here is another outstanding project from my statistical learning course, this one formatted as a blog post.
The project collected tweets about sexual violence, and used an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called latent Dirichlet allocation to discover hidden topic groupings. Its would be quite challenging for a human reader to parse huge amounts of text and organize them, so this is a really exciting area of research.
There were some really surprising results that came out of this analysis, [have a look.](https://jessdoesdatascience.wordpress.com/2016/12/20/sexual-violence-twitter-lda/)
Please give Jess and Jason lots of encouragement so they keep working on this in the spring semester - this work has a lot of potential, hopefully this is just the start.
