Since the schedule is up now, I guess I can say that I''m excited to be offering 2 new interdisciplinary electives this spring.

Machine learning and art, to be co-taught with an amazing artist and adjunct professor, Ingrid Burrington:

Data Science Projects for Social Good, to be co-taught with an equally amazing architect, adjunct professor, and Cooper alum Will Shapiro:
