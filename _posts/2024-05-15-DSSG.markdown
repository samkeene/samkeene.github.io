We opended our annual data science for social good exhibition today. Once again we partnered with several non profits and performed data visualization and analysis. Have a look below for descriptions of the projects and some pictures of the installation.

[The National Black Womans Justice Institute](https://www.nbwji.org/)  mission is to research, elevate, and educate the public about innovative, community-led solutions to address the criminalization of Black women and girls. We partnered with them to do an analysis on the distance between incarcerated women in NYC and their home communities.

[Accelerating Circularity](https://www.acceleratingcircularity.org/) is a nonprofit that catalyzes new circular supply chains and business models to turn used textiles into mainstream raw materials. We developed an educational exhibit on the circular economy with 2 components. The first was a live action game that illustrates the difficulty of rapidly sorting textiles. The seconds was a series of infographics, printed on clothing, around the topics of clothing recycling.
