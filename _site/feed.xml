<p><a href="https://www.nbwji.org/">The National Black Womans Justice Institute</a>  mission is to research, elevate, and educate the public about innovative, community-led solutions to address the criminalization of Black women and girls. We partnered with them to do an analysis on the distance between incarcerated women in NYC and their home communities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.acceleratingcircularity.org/">Accelerating Circularity</a> is a nonprofit that catalyzes new circular supply chains and business models to turn used textiles into mainstream raw materials. We developed an educational exhibit on the circular economy with 2 components. The first was a live action game that illustrates the difficulty of rapidly sorting textiles. The seconds was a series of infographics, printed on clothing, around the topics of clothing recycling.</p>

<p><a href="https://bailproject.org/">The Bail Project</a> is a national nonprofit organization that pays bail for people in need, reuniting families and restoring the presumption of innocence. We began devloping web-scraping tools to investigate re-arrest rates in Escambi County Florida.</p>

<p>Additionally we design and installed an exhibit which will highlight the inequities of bail amounts with a focus on the human loss of cash bail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.acceleratingcircularity.org/">Accelerating Circularity</a> is a nonprofit that catalyzes new circular supply chains and business models to turn used textiles into mainstream raw materials. We worked with them to analyze the amount of divertible textile in the NYC waste stream. They provided us with a dataset about a hand sorted and labeled sample of trash collected in collaboration with the department of sanitation. We provided them with an analysis, and developed an installation around the topic of textile recyling.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.housingrightsny.org/">Housing Rights Initiative</a> is a national non-profit watchdog group that investigates real estate fraud, connects tenants to legal services, and promotes tenants’ rights to fair and affordable housing. For this project, they shared with us a dataset related to an investigation they performed on voucher discrminations. They called numerous landlords and brokers about posted vacancies and asked if they would accept a housing voucher. To refuse a voucher is illegal, but many landlords and brokers nonetheless refuse or avoid accepting them. They provided with us a dataset of the locations of all the apartments they investigated, what happened when they called, and whether or not they felt it warranted filing a claim against the landlord or broker.</p>

<p>With this dataset, we provided an analysis of the demographics of the neighborhoods to gain some insight into where this type of discrimination is more prevalant. We also developed an <a href="https://streeteasy-but-hard-production.up.railway.app/">interactive website</a> to highlight this issue.</p>

<h2 id="emotions"><strong>Emotions</strong></h2>

<p>The user sits inside a mirrored chamber, where an AI detects their emotion. These cues are fed to a generative algorithm which creates images illuminating the chamber.</p>

<h2 id="replacement"><strong>Replacement</strong></h2>

<p>This piece classifies the users age, gender, race, and emotion. It then replaces the users face with a generated version of themselves as the AI sees them. It can be deeply unsettling to see yourself replaced, particularly when the biases of AI are revealed in the process.</p>

They have provided us with a database with information about all of their program participants, as well as an alumni survey. They have asked us to formulate a definition of success for their participants, and perform data analysis and visualization to help understand what factors contribute to this. Additionally, there is an interactive sculpture to illustrate the pathways participants in the program take towards finding stability in their lives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.grameenamerica.org/">Grameen America</a> is dedicated to helping entrepreneurial women who live in poverty build businesses to enable financial mobility. Participants in their programs must attend regular group meetings in order to be eligible for micro-loans to support their businesses. Upon leaving the program, participants are asked to complete an exit survey, which Grameen America has shared with us. The results include a natural language processing based analysis of the free text, infographics, and a large data visualization sculpture.</p>

<p><a href="https://myleapfund.com/">Leap Fund</a> is creating products that empower optimism, financial and career growth, future planning, and security for working families that need it most. One of their products is a coaching program which is deployed at community organizations across the country to help make people aware of the so-called ‘benefits cliff’, which can occur when an increase in income results in a significant decrease in government benefits. Leap Fund has shared with us survey results related to the coaching program, and has asked us to perform analysis and visualization to help improve this program. In addition to this analysis, we have installed an interactive exhibit that aims to raise awareness of the “benefits cliff” problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kidney.org/">National Kidney Foundation</a>, is dedicated to preventing kidney disease, improving the health and well-being of individuals and families affected by kidney disease and increasing the availability of kidneys for transplantation. NKF is interested in improving their outreach to the Latino community. In particular, they have an interest in developing a coherent message highlighting the risk of kidney disease in this population, without making an explicit comparison to the white population. We have conducted a search of all publicly available datasets to determine appropriate statistics we can reference to help develop this message. Additionally, we will develop infographics, pamphlets and other material aimed at the Latino community to increase their awareness of kidney disease. Finally, a virtual reality installation has been designed to illustrate the importance of healthy eating habits in the prevention of kidney disease.</p>
